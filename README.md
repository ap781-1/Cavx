Welcome to the repository for our novel CaviaR Model with HFD implementation. This repository contains code that extends the original Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk (CAViaR) model by incorporating High-Frequency Data (HFD) to enhance financial risk estimation.
Features:
Implementation of multiple CaviaR model specifications with HFD components.
Utilization of high-frequency financial data to improve risk prediction accuracy.
Optimization techniques for parameter estimation.
Performance evaluation with backtesting methodologies.
